I am a lecturer at the Victoria University of Wellington. My research is focused on ethics and political philosophy, with particular attention paid to debates between libertarians, socialists, and anarchists over the moral status of the market and the state.

I am particularly interested in left-libertarianism---a philosophical position that holds that certain moral principles traditionally associated with libertarianism are compatible with egalitarian views about the distribution of resources. While standard accounts of left-libertarianism emphasize the mere compatibility of libertarian and egalitarian principles, I seek to demonstrate that core libertarian principles actually _entail_ that goods should be distributed in accordance with the egalitarian principles typically associated with the socialist left.
