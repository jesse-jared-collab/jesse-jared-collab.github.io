I am a Research Fellow at Trinity College Dublin working on the project [REAL - _Rights and Egalitarianism_](https://www.realresearch.eu/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research is focused on ethics and political philosophy with particular attention paid to debates between libertarians, socialists, and anarchists over the moral status of the market and the state.

I am particularly interested in left-libertarianism---a philosophical position that holds that certain moral principles traditionally associated with libertarianism are compatible with egalitarian views about the distribution of resources. While standard accounts of left-libertarianism emphasize the mere compatibility of libertarian and egalitarian principles, I seek to demonstrate that core libertarian principles actually _entail_ that goods should be distributed in accordance with the egalitarian principles typically associated with the socialist left.
