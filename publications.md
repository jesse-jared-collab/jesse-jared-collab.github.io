My research focuses on debates between libertarians, socialists, and anarchists over the moral status of the market and the state. I'm particularly interested in consent, philosophical anarchism, luck egalitarianism, self-ownership, private property, initial appropriation, and analytical Marxism. My long-term project is to provide a normative defense of a heterodox variety of anarchism.

My near-term project is completing my dissertation wherein I defend the coherence of left-libertarianism by showing that socialist conclusions can be derived from libertarian premises. Specifically, the dissertation contends that libertarians who hold a consent theory of legitimacy are committed to the conclusion that consent is also a necessary condition of the initial appropriation of private property, as property ownership is a form of legitimacy in the relevant sense. However, given that (practically) no one has consented to the appropriation of natural resources, it follows that no one is entitled to the private property they claim. Finally, the dissertation contends that, in the absence of existent property rights, libertarians should embrace a luck egalitarian principle of distributive justice, as this principle best reflects the tacit egalitarianism built into both consent theories of legitimacy and the libertarian thesis of full self-ownership.
