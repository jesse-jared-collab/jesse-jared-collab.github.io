# Publications

My research focuses on debates between libertarians, socialists, and anarchists over the moral status of the market and the state. I'm particularly interested in consent, philosophical anarchism, luck egalitarianism, self-ownership, private property and its original acquisition, and analytical Marxism. My long-term project is to provide a normative defense of a heterodox variety of anarchism.

**Papers**

"An Anarchist Interpretation of Marx's 'Ability to Needs' Principle." (forthcoming) *The Journal of Value Inquiry*.

"Community as Socialist Value." (forthcoming) *Public Affairs Quarterly*.
