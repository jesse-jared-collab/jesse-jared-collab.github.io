My research focuses on debates between libertarians, socialists, and anarchists over the moral status of the market and the state. I'm particularly interested in consent, philosophical anarchism, luck egalitarianism, self-ownership, private property and its original acquisition, and analytical Marxism. My long-term project is to provide a normative defense of a heterodox variety of anarchism.
