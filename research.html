    <p>My research focuses on debates between libertarians, socialists, and anarchists over the moral status of the market and the state. I’m particularly interested in consent, philosophical anarchism, luck egalitarianism, self-ownership, private property, initial appropriation, and analytical Marxism. My long-term project is to provide a normative defense of a heterodox variety of anarchism.</p>

<p>My near-term project is completing my dissertation wherein I argue that socialist conclusions can be derived from libertarian premises. Specifically, I note that many libertarians take the state to be legitimate only if it has received the consent of those whom it claims to govern. However, I contend that the owners of private property are legitimate authorities in the relevant sense—and, thus, the consistent libertarian position is to hold that the acquisition of property has consent as its necessary condition. Given that no one has, in fact, consented to the acquisition of private property, I argue that libertarians should give up on property rights and, instead, embrace a luck egalitarian principle of distributive justice, as this principle best reflects the tacit egalitarianism built into both consent theories of legitimacy and the libertarian thesis of full self-ownership.</p>
