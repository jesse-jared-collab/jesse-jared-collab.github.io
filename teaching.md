I have spent three years desinging and teaching introductory courses in philosophy to undergraduates at Brooklyn College. This has given me the opportunity to work with a diverse range of traditional and non-traditional college students coming from a wide variety of backgrounds. I have also worked with high school seniors at the Dalton School, where I planned and led small group discussions on topics in political philosophy.

When it comes to teaching, I am interested in developing novel and effective teaching practices that also reflect egalitarian and anti-authoritarian values. For example, I have regularly included in my syllabi a "democracy in the classroom" policy giving students the power to democratically shape all aspects of the curriculum (excluding grading practices). I am also interested in [alternative grading practices](http://dailynous.com/2019/03/27/grade-anarchy-student-learning-guest-post-marcus-schultz-bergin/), and have experimented with effort-based grading schemes that have, so far, yielded results that I have judged to be generally favorable, though not without certain limited drawbacks. 

I have also been trained in the pedagocial practices associated with the [Writing Across the Curriculum](https://www.jstor.org/stable/377412?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) movement.

## Courses Taught and Developed

**Introduction to the Problems of Philosophy**

This introductory course is designed to expose students who have never before taken a philosophy course to a broad range of philosophical ideas and arguments. Its assigned readings attempt to balance the inclusion of (a) papers that have proven influential within the discipline, (b) papers that give a sense of the broader philosophical terrain, (b) papers that are fun and exciting, and (d) papers that I think are particularly important. It also attempts to sustain a degree of general coherence across different the subdisciplines, with later papers building on ideas presented in papers covered earlier in the semester. While it covers some historical texts, the readings covered skew heavily toward contemporary authors writing in the analytic tradition.

**Business Ethics**

This introductory course is intended for students who are not necessarily inclined to take another philosophy course. It attempts to run through the major moral questions that will face people who go into business, either as laborers or entrepreneurs. The course takes a primarily political approach, attempting to introduce big-picture questions about how economic acitivity ought to be structured. It also covers classic questions in business ethics (e.g., stakeholder vs. shareholder theory) and explores how major abstract ethical theories can be applied to practical questions facing workers and businesspeople.
