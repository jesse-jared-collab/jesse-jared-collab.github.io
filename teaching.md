I have designed two introductory philosophy courses and taught six sections of undergraduates at Brooklyn College. This has given me the opportunity to work with a diverse range of traditional and non-traditional college students coming from a wide variety of backgrounds. I have also worked with high school seniors at the Dalton School, where I planned and led small group discussions on various topics in political philosophy.

When it comes to teaching, I am interested in developing novel and effective teaching practices that also reflect egalitarian and anti-authoritarian principles. For example, I have regularly included in my syllabi a "democracy in the classroom" policy giving students the power to democratically shape all aspects of the curriculum (excluding grading practices). I am also interested in [alternative grading practices](http://dailynous.com/2019/03/27/grade-anarchy-student-learning-guest-post-marcus-schultz-bergin/), and have experimented with effort-based grading schemes to generally favorable results.

I have also received training in the pedagocial practices associated with the [Writing Across the Curriculum](https://www.jstor.org/stable/377412?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) movement.

## Courses Taught and Developed

**Introduction to the Problems of Philosophy**

This introductory course is designed to expose students who have never before taken a philosophy course to a broad range of philosophical ideas and arguments. Its assigned readings attempt to balance the inclusion of (a) papers that have proven influential within the discipline, (b) papers that give a sense of the broader philosophical terrain, (c) papers that are fun and exciting, and (d) papers that I think are particularly important. The readings are also intended to cohere with one another, even as they span the different the subdisciplines; specifically, they have been selected with the intention that papers covered later in the course will build directly upon the arguments and ideas covered earlier in the semester. While the readings include some historical texts, the course primarily features contemporary authors writing in the analytic tradition.

**Business Ethics**

This introductory course is intended for students who are not necessarily inclined to take another philosophy course. It attempts to run through the major moral questions that will face people who go into business, either as laborers or entrepreneurs. The course takes a primarily political approach, attempting to introduce big-picture questions about how economic acitivity ought to be structured. It also covers classic questions in business ethics (e.g., stakeholder vs. shareholder theory) and explores how major abstract ethical theories can be applied to practical questions facing workers and businesspeople.
