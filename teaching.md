When it comes to teaching, I am interested in developing engaging, creative, and effective pedagogical practices that also reflect egalitarian and anti-authoritarian principles. Below I provide some of the materials that I use in my classes as well as a list of the courses I have taught and the syllabi for those courses.

## Resources

I sometimes have students write four-sentence papers. [Here](/files/FourSentence.pdf){:target="_blank"} is my handout introducing this assignment.

 [Here](/files/PaperWriting.pdf){:target="_blank"} is my more general guide to writing critical philosophy papers.
