When it comes to teaching, I am interested in developing engaging, creative, and effective pedagogical practices that also reflect egalitarian and anti-authoritarian principles. I have provided below some of the materials that I have produced as well as a list of the courses I have taught along with the syllabi for those courses.

I have also received training in the pedagocial practices associated with the [Writing Across the Curriculum](https://www.jstor.org/stable/377412?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents){:target="_blank"} movement.

## Courses Taught and Developed

**Introduction to the Problems of Philosophy**

An introductory course designed to expose students to a broad range of philosophical ideas and arguments. Its assigned readings attempt to balance the inclusion of (a) papers that have proven influential within the discipline, (b) papers that give a sense of the broader philosophical terrain, (c) papers that are fun and exciting, and (d) papers that I think are particularly important. The readings are also intended to cohere with one another, even as they span the different subdisciplines; specifically, they have been selected with the intention that papers covered later in the course will build directly upon the arguments and ideas covered earlier in the semester. While the readings include some historical texts, the course primarily features contemporary authors writing in the analytic tradition.

**Business Ethics**

An introductory course intended for students who are not necessarily inclined to take another philosophy course. It covers some of the major moral questions that will face people who go into business, either as laborers or entrepreneurs. The course takes a primarily political approach, attempting to introduce big-picture questions about how economic acitivity ought to be structured. It also covers classic questions in business ethics (e.g., stakeholder vs. shareholder theory) and explores how major abstract ethical theories can be applied to practical questions facing workers and businesspeople.
